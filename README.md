# digit_recogniser
Able to recognise digits from image using SVC trainer from scikit-learn.
I've trained the classifier from the inbuilt datasets of sklearn (Load_digits).
I've created those sample images on simple paint app.

# How it works
First,run train.py to create trained classifier and save it locally, Once trained, use predict.py on sample image to detect.

# Packages required
--python3  
  numpy  
  sklearn  
  scipy  
  _pickle
