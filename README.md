# digit_recogniser
Able to recognise digits from image using SVC trainer from scikit-learn.
I've trained the classifier from the inbuilt datasets of sklearn (Load_digits).
Currently, it will recognise digits image listed as above way only (background are darker than digit).I'll try to update this module to work in every condition.
I've created those sample images on simple paint app.

#how it works
First,run train.py to create trained classifier and save it locally, Once trained, use predict.py on sample image to detect.
